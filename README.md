Use WASD to move horizontally in space, hold SHIFT to "sprint".
Use LEFT CTRL to move lower and SPACE to move higher.

To see level sequence, move into the designated level area. 
It will recognize you accessing the level.

Press ENTER to step through the level sequence / progressign the level / what should be happening.
Press ESCAPE to reset the level.

The sequencing in this sandbox is only for visualization purposes and should get the idea across, what would need to be implemented and how the level may feel progressing through it.

For details on what exactly may happen in each level, please refer to our MIRA board.


NOTE: TimeLv2 (Purple Platforms) has unfinished level sequencing.
Grey platforms are start positions and purple are end positions.
The clock should be turning clockwise non-stop (from up perspective).
